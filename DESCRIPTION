Description: This package allows to process volumetric data from brain MRI/CT scans. An heuristic using skull dimensions is implemented to determine comparable points of origins for different patients. Imaging features (e.g. skewness, distances between a given tumor volume and the brain center of origin) can be extracted. For MRI data, a method for identification of tissue classes (e.g. hypo-,iso-,hyperintense) is provided and can be used for intra-patient normalization of data.
